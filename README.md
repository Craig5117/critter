## Usage

To use CritterTails, sign your pet up first. Then you can change your pet's default image on their profile page. Then use the form on your pet's profile page to add your pet's latest "Tail". Click on a tail on a user's profile page or the home page, and you can comment as well. Use the search bar to filter the latest Tails by pet name. Use the dropdown menu on the home page to filter the list of pet users by pet type (dog, cat, etc...).
